# Sentiment Analysis Website

This project is a sentiment analysis website that allows users to input text and determine its sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using a deep learning model based on the BERT architecture and the Hugging Face Transformers library.

## Overview

The website is built using Flask and integrates with the Ramsey API repository, which provides a simple interface for users to input text and receive sentiment analysis results. The project involves the following components:

1. **Text Input**: Users can input text through the website's interface.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: The text is sent to the Ramsey API, which uses a pre-trained deep learning model to analyze the sentiment of the input text.
3. **Result Display**: The website displays the sentiment analysis result (positive, negative, or neutral) to the user.

4. The website will display the sentiment analysis result for the input text.

## Credits

This project is built using the Ramsey API repository, which provides the sentiment analysis functionality. A huge shoutout to Ramsey for creating and maintaining the API!
